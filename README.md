# Test Repository

This repository is equipped with automated documentation management powered by Claude AI.

## ðŸ¤– Automated Documentation

This repository uses a weekly automated README update system that:

- **Analyzes code changes** from the past 7 days
- **Updates documentation** to reflect new features and changes
- **Creates pull requests** for review and approval
- **Runs every Monday** at 1:30 PM UTC (scheduled)

### How It Works

The automation is handled by the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/claude-readme.yml`, which:

1. Analyzes recent commits and file changes
2. Uses Claude AI to understand code changes and update documentation
3. Creates a pull request with the updated README
4. Provides detailed analysis of what changed and why

### Manual Triggers

You can manually trigger a documentation update by:
- Going to the Actions tab
- Selecting "Weekly README Update Original" 
- Clicking "Run workflow"
- Optionally checking "Force update" to update even without recent changes
