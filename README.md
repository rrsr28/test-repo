# Weekly README Update Test Repository

This repository demonstrates automated README updates using Claude AI via GitHub Actions.

## Overview

The repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically analyzes code changes from the past week and updates the README.md file using Claude AI. This provides an example of how to integrate AI-powered documentation updates into your development workflow.

## Features

- **Automated Analysis**: Scans commits from the last 7 days
- **AI-Powered Updates**: Uses Claude AI to analyze changes and update documentation
- **Pull Request Workflow**: Creates PRs for review before merging documentation changes
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed analysis of commits, files changed, and code statistics

## Workflow Configuration

The main workflow (`.github/workflows/claude-readme.yml`) runs:
- Weekly on schedule (Monday at 4:30 AM UTC)
- On manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
- Only when there are actual code changes to analyze

## Recent Updates

**Latest Changes (June 20-27, 2025):**
- Refined workflow configuration with 4 commits to `claude-readme.yml`
- Removed deprecated `new2.yml` workflow file
- Streamlined automation process

## Usage

This repository serves as a template for implementing automated documentation updates in your own projects. The workflow can be customized to fit different documentation needs and update frequencies.
