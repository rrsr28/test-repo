# test-repo

An intelligent GitHub repository featuring automated documentation management powered by Claude AI.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Weekly Automated README Updates
This repository includes a sophisticated GitHub Actions workflow that analyzes development activity and maintains up-to-date documentation:

- **Schedule**: Runs every Monday at 4:30 AM UTC  
- **Analysis Period**: Reviews the last 7 days of commits and code changes
- **Smart Updates**: Creates pull requests only when meaningful changes are detected
- **AI-Powered**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4 to analyze code changes and update documentation intelligently

### ðŸ“‹ Workflow Details

The automated README update workflow (`claude-readme.yml`) performs comprehensive analysis:

1. **Change Detection**: Analyzes commits from the past 7 days
2. **File Analysis**: Tracks all modified files and code changes (+additions/-deletions)
3. **Intelligent Updates**: Uses Claude AI to determine if README updates are needed
4. **PR Creation**: Automatically creates pull requests with detailed change summaries
5. **Clean Operations**: Removes temporary analysis files after completion

### ðŸ”§ Workflow Configuration

```yaml
# Scheduled weekly runs
schedule:
  - cron: '30 13 * * *'  # Every Monday at 4:30 AM UTC

# Manual trigger option
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:

```

## How It Works

The automation workflow follows this process:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Examines the last 7 days of commits and generates detailed change reports
2. **AI Review**: Claude AI analyzes the changes to determine documentation relevance
3. **Update Phase**: If changes affect user-facing functionality, README.md is updated
4. **PR Creation**: Creates a pull request with detailed analysis and change summary
5. **Assignment**: Automatically assigns the PR to the repository owner for review

## Development
