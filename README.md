# Automated README Synchronization System

This repository features an intelligent automated documentation system that keeps the README.md file synchronized with code changes using AI-powered analysis.

## Overview

The **Claude README Sync** workflow automatically analyzes repository changes and updates documentation when triggered by pull request events. This ensures that documentation stays current with development without manual intervention.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Documentation Updates
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Uses Claude AI to analyze code changes from the last 7 days
- **Context-Aware Updates**: Understands the purpose and impact of changes, not just file modifications
- **Smart Content Generation**: Creates comprehensive documentation that explains functionality and usage

### ðŸ”„ Automated Workflow Management
- **PR-Triggered Analysis**: Automatically runs when pull requests are opened or updated
- **Separate Documentation PRs**: Creates dedicated pull requests for README updates to maintain clean history
- **Branch Management**: Automatically creates timestamped branches for documentation changes
- **Conflict Prevention**: Works independently of main development to avoid merge conflicts

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Change Tracking
- **7-Day Analysis Window**: Analyzes all changes from the past week for comprehensive updates
- **File Change Detection**: Identifies and analyzes modified files and their impact
- **Commit History Review**: Examines commit messages and code changes to understand development context

## Technical Implementation

### Workflow Configuration
- **Trigger**: Pull request events (`opened`, `synchronize`)
- **Runtime**: Ubuntu-latest with full repository history
- **Permissions**: Write access to contents and pull requests
- **Timeout**: 45-minute maximum execution time

### Allowed Tools
The Claude AI instance has access to:
- **Git Operations**: Config, checkout, branch management, status, logging, diff, add, commit, push
- **File System**: File reading, globbing, grep searching, editing
- **GitHub API**: File access, branch creation, PR creation, issue commenting
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple file operations for efficient processing

### Environment Variables
- `SINCE_DATE`: Analysis start date (7 days ago)
- `COMMIT_COUNT`: Number of commits to analyze
- `BRANCH_NAME`: Unique timestamped branch for documentation updates
- `CHANGED_FILES`: List of files modified in the analysis period

## Usage

### Automatic Operation
The system operates automatically when:
1. A pull request is opened against the repository
2. An existing pull request is updated (synchronized)
3. Changes are detected in the last 7 days

### Manual Triggering
While designed for automatic operation, the workflow can be manually triggered through GitHub Actions if needed.

### Branch Naming Convention
Documentation branches follow the pattern: `readme-sync-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`

## Configuration

### Required Secrets
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY2`: API key for Claude AI integration
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

### Workflow Customization
The analysis period, tools, and behavior can be modified in `.github/workflows/hi.yml`:
- Adjust the 7-day analysis window
- Modify allowed tools for Claude AI
- Customize PR creation templates
- Update timeout settings

## Error Handling

### Skip Conditions
- No commits found in the analysis period
- No changes requiring documentation updates
- API rate limits or temporary service issues

### Fallback Behavior
- Graceful handling of empty commit histories
- Appropriate messaging when no updates are needed
- Automatic cleanup of unused branches

## Integration Benefits

### For Development Teams
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Documentation updates happen automatically
- **Consistent Quality**: AI ensures comprehensive and well-structured documentation
- **Change Tracking**: Clear record of when and why documentation changed
- **Review Process**: Documentation changes go through PR review like code changes

### For Repository Users
- **Always Current**: Documentation stays synchronized with the latest features
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: AI analysis ensures no significant changes are missed
- **Professional Quality**: Consistent formatting and comprehensive explanations
