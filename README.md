# Test Repository

## Overview

This repository is designed for testing automated README updates using Claude Code through GitHub Actions.

## Automated Documentation

This project features an automated README update system that:

- **Weekly Analysis**: Automatically analyzes code changes from the past 7 days
- **AI-Powered Updates**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4 to generate meaningful documentation updates
- **Change Tracking**: Monitors commits, file changes, and code statistics
- **Pull Request Workflow**: Creates PRs for README updates with detailed change summaries

### System Status

- **Analysis Period**: 2025-06-17 to 2025-06-24
- **Commits Analyzed**: 0 commits (no changes in analysis period)
- **Last Update**: 2025-06-24
- **Automation Status**: Active

## Workflow Features

The automated system includes:

- **Scheduled Updates**: Runs every Monday at 4:30 AM UTC
- **Manual Triggers**: Can be manually triggered via workflow dispatch
- **Change Detection**: Skips updates when no meaningful changes are detected
- **Smart Analysis**: Compares against baseline commits for accurate diff generation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed analysis files and change summaries

## Recent Activity

Recent repository activity has focused on refining the automated README update workflow (`claude-readme.yml`):

- **Workflow Optimization**: Multiple updates to improve change detection and analysis
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced fallback strategies for edge cases
- **Process Refinement**: Improved diff generation and file handling
