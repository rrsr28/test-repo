# test-repo

## Overview

This repository demonstrates automated README synchronization using Claude AI, triggered by pull request events.

## Features

### Automated README Synchronization

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/hi.yml`) that:

- **Triggers**: Automatically runs on pull request events (opened, synchronize)
- **Analysis Period**: Analyzes the last 7 days of development activity
- **AI-Powered Updates**: Uses Claude AI to intelligently update documentation
- **Smart Branching**: Creates dedicated branches for README updates
- **PR Creation**: Automatically creates pull requests for documentation changes

### Workflow Capabilities

The synchronization workflow provides:

1. **Change Analysis**: Reviews commits, changed files, and code modifications
2. **Content Generation**: AI-generated README updates based on code changes
3. **Branch Management**: Automatic creation and cleanup of update branches
4. **Pull Request Automation**: Creates PRs with detailed analysis summaries
5. **Conditional Updates**: Only creates PRs when README changes are actually needed

### Technical Details

- **Runtime**: Ubuntu-latest GitHub Actions runner
- **Permissions**: Write access to contents and pull requests
- **AI Integration**: Anthropics Claude Code Action
- **Timeout**: 45-minute execution limit
- **Git Configuration**: Automated commits as 'Claude Bot'

## Usage

The workflow runs automatically when:
- New pull requests are opened
- Existing pull requests are synchronized (new commits pushed)

No manual intervention is required - the system maintains documentation automatically based on code changes.

## Configuration

The workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/hi.yml` and includes:
- Analysis of 7-day development windows
- Intelligent README content generation
- Automatic PR creation and management
- Integration with Claude AI for natural language documentation
