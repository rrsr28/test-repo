# test-repo

A GitHub repository with advanced automated documentation management capabilities powered by Claude AI.

## ðŸ¤– Automated Documentation System

This repository features a sophisticated weekly README update system that analyzes code changes and maintains documentation automatically.

### ðŸ“… Weekly README Updates

- **Schedule**: Every Monday at 4:30 AM UTC (automated via GitHub Actions)
- **Analysis Period**: Reviews the last 7 days of development activity  
- **AI-Powered**: Uses Claude Sonnet-4 to analyze changes and update documentation
- **Pull Request Workflow**: Creates separate PRs for documentation updates with detailed analysis

### ðŸ”§ Workflow Features

The automated system (`.github/workflows/claude-readme.yml`) includes:

- **Smart Analysis**: Examines commit history, file changes, and code diffs
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed analysis files for accurate updates
- **Change Detection**: Only creates PRs when meaningful changes are detected
- **Fallback Strategies**: Handles edge cases like new repositories or minimal changes
- **Clean Automation**: Automatically cleans up temporary analysis files

### ðŸ“Š Analysis Capabilities

The workflow generates multiple analysis files:
- `detailed_analysis_temp.txt` - Complete commit and file change analysis
- `weekly_changes_temp.diff` - Full git diff of code changes
- `recent_commits_temp.txt` - Formatted commit messages with metadata
- `changed_files_temp.txt` - List of all modified files
